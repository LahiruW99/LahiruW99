👋 Hi, I'm Lahiru Wijesooriya — a passionate QA Engineer with 2+ years of experience in manual testing, test automation, and end-to-end quality ownership.

🔍 I work across multiple fast-paced projects as a solo QA, contributing to both test strategy and hands-on execution. I specialize in:
- Writing and executing test cases
- Defect reporting and triaging
- Web automation using Playwright
- Continuous learning and improvement

✅ ISTQB Foundation Level Certified  
💡 Currently exploring better QA practices, scalable automation, and test architecture.

📌 Tech I use: Playwright, JavaScript/TypeScript, Postman, GitHub Actions

Let's raise the bar for quality — together.
